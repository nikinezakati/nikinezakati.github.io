    <h3>3D Reconstruction and Neural Rendering</h3>
    <p>
      Many real-world tasks require understanding scenes in 3D from sparse or unconstrained inputs. I work on reconstructing 3D scenes using COLMAP for camera pose estimation, followed by neural rendering methods such as NeRF and Gaussian Splatting for high-fidelity reconstruction and view synthesis. My work includes integrating object detection and spatial reasoning into these pipelines, enabling more accurate and semantically aware 3D representations.
